description: A collection of links to posts about algorithms and data structures.

Here I'm going to collect the links to my posts about various
algorithms and data structures. Even the simplest ones.

I actually believe in immortality of algorithms and data
structures. Technologies and programming languages are born and die
every day. On the other hand, algorithms and data structures usually
live a very long life. For example, the
[Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)
was invented in 300 BC and still remains in use.
