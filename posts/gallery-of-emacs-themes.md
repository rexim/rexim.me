description: Gallery of emacs themes.

Recently, I found [this](http://emacsthemes.caisah.info/) nice gallery
of Emacs themes by [caisah](http://caisah.info/). I always wanted such
site to exist. Even considered making one. But the author already has
done a
[great work](http://emacsthemes.caisah.info/about-emacs-themes/). The
gallery even contains my deftheme port of
[Gruber Darker Theme](https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme)!
