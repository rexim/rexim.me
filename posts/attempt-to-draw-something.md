description: Just a little try to draw something

In the yesterday's evening I was trying to draw something. And that's
what came out:

<img alt="Sitting Pony" src="/images/sitting-pony.svg" style="width: 70%;" />

Never thought I can draw anything more complex than a circle. At the
beginning was a simple pencil sketch:

<img alt="Sitting Pony Sketch" src="/images/sitting-pony-sketch.png" style="width: 70%;"/>

Which I scanned and then manually vectorized using
[Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/). I would like to colorize the
drawing. But not yet. Maybe a little bit later.
